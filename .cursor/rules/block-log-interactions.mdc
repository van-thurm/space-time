# Block Log Interaction Rules

Use these interaction guardrails for all newly added or edited UI controls:

1. Primary interactive controls should use minimum target size `>= 42x42`.
2. Critical navigation and destructive actions must include visible text labels.
3. Avoid unlabeled icon-only actions for any flow exit, navigation, or destructive behavior.
4. Every button/link/control must provide:
   - semantic role (`button` or `a`)
   - clear `aria-label` when text is not sufficient
   - visible `focus-visible` state
5. Keep touch and keyboard parity:
   - no interaction pattern should require precise tap placement
   - keyboard navigation must be usable for header controls and key action bars
6. Preserve business logic while polishing UI. Navigation and interaction refactors should not modify workout/program data behavior.
