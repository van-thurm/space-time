# Block Log Navigation Contract

Apply this contract to every secondary page in Block Log (any route other than `/`):

1. Header must include a left nav cluster with:
   - back action rendered as icon + visible short label (`back`)
   - explicit home/dashboard affordance rendered as icon + visible short label (`dashboard` or `programs`)
2. Do not use icon-only single-path exits for primary navigation.
3. Back behavior cannot rely solely on browser history:
   - use a deterministic fallback route when back stack is unsafe
   - fallback should be context-aware when possible (`/`, `/programs`, or related parent route)
4. Navigation controls must be touch-friendly:
   - minimum interactive hit target: `42x42`
   - spacing must avoid precision taps
5. Right-side utility cluster should use consistent geometry with existing controls (`ThemeToggle`, optional page action).
6. All nav controls must expose meaningful `aria-label` text.
7. Keyboard users must see clear focus styling on all interactive header controls.
